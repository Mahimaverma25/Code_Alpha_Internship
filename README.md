# Code_Alpha_Internship
Hi Guy's I'm Mahima Verma recantly I have join an Internship in CodeAlpha as a Python programming development. I am Very excited to get some working experience on a project whcih help me 
to enhance my knowledge. As a python learning begginer I recently  don't have much Knowledege to code like a professional programmer but yeah, I can try my best to learn it deeper and hopefully apply all my knowledege.I hope I'll get more efficent and effective knowledge then put it as a great resoure to help people ...😊

Task 1:- Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a simple, fun, and interactive word-guessing game where the player tries to guess the correct word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. Each wrong guess brings the player closer to losing the game, hence the term "Hangman."

How to Play
Game Start: The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list.
Guessing: The player will guess one letter at a time.
Correct Guess: If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position.
Incorrect Guess: If the letter is not in the word, the player loses one attempt.
Winning: The player wins if they can guess all the letters in the word before running out of attempts.
Losing: The player loses if they run out of attempts without guessing the correct word.

Features
Random Word Selection: Words are chosen randomly from a predefined list.
Limited Attempts: The player has a fixed number of attempts (usually 6) before losing the game.
Word Masking: Correctly guessed letters are revealed while incorrect ones are hidden.
Interactive: The game continues until the player either wins or loses.
Simple UI: The game is text-based, with clear instructions displayed throughout.


Task 2 :- chatBot

Welcome to the Basic Chatbot project! This is a simple, rule-based chatbot designed to simulate conversations with a user. The chatbot can respond to specific keywords and patterns, providing a basic level of interaction. It is perfect for learning about natural language processing (NLP) and chatbot development.

Features
Keyword-based Responses: The chatbot matches user input with predefined keywords and responds accordingly.
Simple Conversation Flow: The chatbot can carry on simple conversations and provide predefined responses.
Customizable: Easily add more keywords and responses to extend the chatbot's capabilities.
Basic NLP: The chatbot can handle basic user input and respond with relevant information.
24/7 Availability: Chatbots never sleep! They provide instant support to customers, no matter the time zone or hour.
Improved Customer Experience: Chatbots deliver quick and accurate responses, reducing wait times and frustration.
Cost Efficiency: They handle repetitive queries, freeing up human agents for more complex tasks and saving operational costs.
Scalability: Chatbots can handle a large volume of inquiries simultaneously, ensuring your business scales smoothly without compromising on quality.

Task 3:- Task Automation with Scripting

Automating tasks using scripts can greatly improve efficiency by reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. You can automate tasks such as builds, tests, deployments, and more directly within your GitHub repository.

Benefits of Automation
Time-saving: Automates repetitive tasks.
Error reduction: Minimizes manual intervention.
Consistency: Ensures tasks are performed the same way every time.

Common Use Cases
Build and Test Automation: Automatically trigger builds and run tests on every commit.
Deployment: Deploy to staging or production environments with minimal effort.
Code Formatting: Automatically format code or run linting on push.
Version Bumping: Update the version number and tag releases.
