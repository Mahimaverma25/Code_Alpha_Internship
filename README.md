# Code_Alpha_Internship
Hi Guy's I'm Mahima Verma recantly I have join an Internship in CodeAlpha as a Python programming development. I am Very excited to get some working experience on a project whcih help me 
to enhance my knowledge. As a python learning begginer I recently  don't have much Knowledege to code like a professional programmer but yeah, I can try my best to learn it deeper and apply all my knowledege.
I hope I'll get more efficent and effective knowledge then put it as a great resoure to help people ...😊
And now  let's talk about my first Task project which is a 'Hangman Game' where we have to guess some correct words at a fix amount of  assumtion time and , if we assume correct word then it will show you ' woohh you won the game' and if we try it more than it's time limit and a incorrect guesses then it will show you that 'you lost the game'.. 
I enjoyed a lot to program this code and play it . ......

There are two more task are here which I have to complete it , I'll talk about them later when I'll able to put all my source code on it....
